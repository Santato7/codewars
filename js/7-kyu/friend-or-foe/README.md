# Friend or Foe

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends' names in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

For example:

- Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
  Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.

`friend(["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"])` should return `["Ryan", "Mark"]`

Note: Keep the original order of the names in the output.
