# Cockroach Speed

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (floored).

For example:

- 1.08 km/h --> 30 cm/s

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
